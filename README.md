# Lunar Bypass
A script developed to bypass mod blocking on some servers using Lunar Client: **Freelook, AutoTextHotkey, Minimap** and etc.
## Installation
1. Download the `bypass.py` script and the `config.json` file.
2. Place the files in the same directory.

## Usage
1. Run the `bypass.py` script (**Python 3.13**) or `bypass.exe` application.
2. The script will automatically detect the Lunar Client installation and perform the necessary steps to bypass mods.
3. Once the bypass is complete, the script will play a sound notification.

## API
The script does not provide any API. It is a standalone utility for bypassing the Lunar Client firewall.
